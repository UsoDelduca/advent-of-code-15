# advent-of-code-15
This is my attempt to solve one of the Advent of Code puzzle using TypeScript

## Disclaimer

I'm not new to Typescript, but I'm also a junior developer  
Learning to debug is part of a developer's career and I'm challenging myself to learn how to debug better and faster  
The way I see it, the more I see the same errors on screen, the easier it will be for me to fix them

## Start project
- To make this work, first I had to set up the TS packages
- Install dependencies
- Figure out why TS wasn't running on Node
- Change tsconfig.json and package.json files
- Run and see the console.log on Node

## Day #1
The main issue was to figure out how to read the input  
The logic wasn't that hard to figure out

## Day #2
Again, the issues was to use the input data  
It took me a little while to find a solution by reading a few forums
